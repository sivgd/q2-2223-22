Dear Reader...

This readme is here to explain how to get the MIDI player working,
the soundfont that is being used is based on the sounds of the
legendary Roland SC-55. However the problem that we run into here is that
the .sf2 soundfont file is larger than 10MB and Source Tree has a big ol'
hissy fit and wont push. This readme is here to explain how to get this to work...

For the midi player to properly work you need to put the 
Roland SC-55 soundfont that I have (hopefully) provided on trello
into the SteamingAssets(VERY IMPORTANT STEP) folder. then you want to find the
emptyObject titled MIDI and find its Synthisizer component
and drag n' drop the SC-55 soundfont onto the Sound Font refrence
and that should be it.

If you have any other inquerys just @ me on Discord, I am Groovy.#4869
